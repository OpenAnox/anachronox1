Description:
-----------

This is a Python script library which can be used to do the work involved in
reading and parsing the file formats that come with the game Anachronox.  the
most functional part of it is the APE decompiler.

Notes:
-----

* dparse.exe

  There are two versions of dparse.exe, the APE compiler.  The first version
dated 2001 comes with the original release of Anachrodox by the game
developers.  The second version dated 2003 comes with one of the game patches
named 'anox_build45_bin.exe' and is prone to crashes.  It is advised that the
user obtain the 2001 version.

* test.txt

  test.txt is intended to be a testbed for all the various APE programming
language constructs.  By compiling it and then decompiling it again, it
should end up with essentially the same code as was initially compiled.

As of 9th April 2007 I believe this is capable of decompiling all the APE
scripts which come with Anachronox so that they can be recompiled without
error.

* What if I don't own the game?

  You can most likely obtain the demo from somewhere and find APE files
within that.  And 'dparse.exe' the APE compiler can be obtained from
two places freely (as documented above).
